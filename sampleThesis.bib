@article{hel17a,
	Abstract = {Thermal quantum time-correlation functions are of fundamental importance in quantum dynamics, allowing experimentally measurable properties such as reaction rates, diffusion constants and vibrational spectra to be computed from first principles. Since the exact quantum solution scales exponentially with system size, there has been considerable effort in formulating reliable linear-scaling methods involving exact quantum statistics and approximate quantum dynamics modelled with classical-like trajectories. Here, we review recent progress in the field with the development of methods including centroid molecular dynamics , ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) and thermostatted RPMD (TRPMD). We show how these methods have recently been obtained from Matsubara dynamics, a form of semiclassical dynamics which conserves the quantum Boltzmann distribution. We also apply the Matsubara formalism to reaction rate theory, rederiving t -> 0+ quantum transition-state theory (QTST) and showing that Matsubara-TST, like RPMD-TST, is equivalent to QTST. We end by surveying areas for future progress.},

	Abstract = {We derive an exact quantum propagator for nonadiabatic dynamics in multi-state systems using the mapping variable representation{,} where classical-like Cartesian variables are used to represent both continuous nuclear degrees of freedom and discrete electronic states. The resulting Liouvillian is a Moyal series that{,} when suitably approximated{,} can allow for the use of classical dynamics to efficiently model large systems. We demonstrate that different truncations of the exact Liouvillian lead to existing approximate semiclassical and mixed quantum-classical methods and we derive an associated error term for each method. Furthermore{,} by combining the imaginary-time path-integral representation of the Boltzmann operator with the exact Liouvillian{,} we obtain an analytic expression for thermal quantum real-time correlation functions. These results provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for the development of accurate and efficient classical-like dynamics to compute observables such as electron transfer reaction rates in complex quantized systems.},

	Abstract = {Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions{,} which involve the transfer of both electrons and protons{,} are essential for many energy conversion processes. The relative timescales of the electrons{,} transferring proton(s){,} solute{,} and solvent{,} as well as the couplings among these components{,} vary widely among PCET processes. This paper presents a scheme for the classification of PCET reactions in terms of these timescales and couplings{,} which are framed in the context of electronic{,} vibrational{,} and vibronic nonadiabaticity. A guide to the theoretical methods that are applicable in the various regimes is also provided. In addition{,} theoretical calculations and physical properties that can be used to classify specific experimentally relevant systems are discussed. The ability to classify PCET reactions will assist in the development of more accurate theoretical treatments and will aid in the interpretation of experimental data. This progress will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of energy conversion processes that rely on PCET reactions.},

Flux auto-correlation and cross-correlation functions are employed to develop a quantitative measure of dynamical coupling in quantum transition events, such as reactive tunnelling and resonant energy transfer. We utilize the method to study condensed-phase proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions and to determine the relative importance of competing concerted and sequential reaction pathways. Results presented here include numerically exact quantum dynamics simulations for model condensed-phase PCET reactions. This work demonstrates the applicability of the new method for the analysis of both approximate and exact quantum dynamics simulations. },

	Abstract = {A general theory has been developed for proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET){,} which is vital to a wide range of chemical and biological processes. This theory describes PCET reactions in terms of nonadiabatic transitions between reactant and product electron-proton vibronic states and includes the effects of thermal fluctuations of the solvent or protein environment{,} as well as the proton donor-acceptor motion. Within the framework of this general PCET theory{,} a series of analytical rate constant expressions has been derived for PCET reactions in well-defined regimes. Herein{,} the application of this theory to PCET in the enzyme soybean lipoxygenase illustrates the regimes of validity for the various rate constant expressions and elucidates the fundamental physical principles dictating PCET reactions. Such theoretical studies provide significant physical insights that guide the interpretation of experimental data and lead to experimentally testable predictions. A combination of theoretical treatments with atomic-level simulations is essential to understanding PCET.},
